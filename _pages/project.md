Vehicle Loction Privacy Protection in Location-based Services
------
Location obfuscation, which allows mobile users to report obfuscated locations instead of the exact locations, has been a dominating location privacy protection paradigm in many location-based services. Yet, the current obfuscation designs fail to address the vulnerabilities of vehicles, of which the mobility is restricted by the underlying road networks and traffic conditions. Particularly, individual vehicles’ mobility is restricted by various road environments, including local road network topology, speed limits, and traffic conditions. Built upon this insight, in this project, our objective is to 1) demonstrate that, with the road network environment and historical traffic flow information provided, vehicles’ trajectory can be inferred with high accuracy even their reported locations have been obfuscated, 2) propose a new location obfuscation paradigm to protect vehicles' location privacy considering the vehicles' mobility features over roads, and 3) develop, deploy, test, and refine the geo-obfuscation methods in dynamic location-based applications.

Our proposed paradigm will include new criteria of privacy as well as a new efficient set of solutions to guarantee high degrees of privacy with minimal quality loss. Particularly, we will consider various vehicles’ mobility features under the road network environment 
(e.g., network-constrained, speed limit, etc.) and also spatial correlations as it occurs when multiple vehicles are on the road (e.g., traffic conditions and regulations). The location privacy protection problem discussed in this project is novel, not only because of the new class of privacy protection mechanisms proposed but also due to vehicle mobility features taken into account in the framework that can be applied to other network-constrained mobile applications.
